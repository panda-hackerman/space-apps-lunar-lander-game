# space-apps-lunar-lander-game
This game was made in 2 days as part of the NASA Space Apps Hackathon. The team members on this project are Grace Pearson, Eli Michaud, And Fabian Hernandez.

Lunar Lander Regolith is built to simulate what it would look like to collect samples of moon regolith and using them to experiment with growing plants on the moon. Moon regolith is basically just moon soil and sediment. Because it costs a lot of money to bring Earth soil to the moon - being able to combine it with moon soil will be very cost-effective and efficient.

This game is free to play in-browser on itch.io (https://elimichaud.itch.io/space-apps-regolith)
